# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Danial, a junior full stack web developer. 

I like to build cool side projects and learn about new technologies.

#### Projects
[CryptoAPI](https://cryptoapi.xyz) | [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/danialhasan/CryptoAPI)<br>
This is a small application I build to apply my knowledge of APIs. It retrieves real data from [this api](https://coinmarketcap.com/api) and displays it for the user. It is functional, but I plan to revamp it in the near future with more features and better styling.
<br>
_Technologies Used_
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api)
- TailwindCSS
<br>

[HWAY Global](https://hwayglobal.com/)<br>
This is a static website I built for a clients business back when I was still learning web development for the first time.
<br>
_Technologies Used_
