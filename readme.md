# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Danial, a junior full stack web developer. 

I like to build cool side projects and learn about new technologies.

#### Projects
[CryptoAPI](https://cryptoapi.xyz) | [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/danialhasan/CryptoAPI)<br>
This is a small application I build to apply my knowledge of APIs. It retrieves real data from [this api](https://coinmarketcap.com/api) and displays it for the user. It is functional, but I plan to revamp it in the near future with more features and better styling.

_Technologies Used_
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api)
- TailwindCSS
