This is a small application I build to apply my knowledge of APIs. It retrieves real data from [this api](https://coinmarketcap.com/api) and displays it for the user. It is functional, but I plan to revamp it in the near future with more features and better styling.

### Current Project (Work In Progress) <br>
This project is a web app where users can login/register to browse collections of images. It's similar to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com) in functionality. It is completely custom built.
<br><br>
_Technologies Used_
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- VueJS
- TailwindCSS
<br>
It's split into two parts, Client and Server. The client holds the frontend code and is hosted on Netlify. The server hosts the backend code and is hosted on Heroku. They communicate via API.
